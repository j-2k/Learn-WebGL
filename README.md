# ~~OpenGL_Trials_1~~ 
~~the first opengl project, it's time to do some proper graphics (Vulkan later).~~

# WebGL Trial Instead
Additionally, I will learn a few JS/TS concepts over making a simple WebGL project, & important concepts below.
1. Stencil JS Project
2. Web Components API
3. Need to relearn important things related to web DOM & Components in a web project.

  - I'm going to use GPT to help me clarify shit while learning some of the topics below + I will need it especially when doing matrix multiplication & when I need an explanation on what happens when an object goes through 50 transformation calcs lmfao

- JS/TS Resources
  - I heard MDN docs isn't "good" for learning JS/TS it's best for references, but they do have resources (I won't be listing them here!), I'm not sure of what is a popular good resource in this area (JS/TS) unlike my expertise in other fields but I will try to list what I have seen suggested by strong web developers in specializations I have delved into the past.

  - [freecodecamp/learn-js&ts](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) I have seen this as popularly suggested as the above resource!
  - [typescriptlang.org-ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) a very good website for typescript related docs & learning ts in general!
  - [theodinproject-js](https://www.theodinproject.com/) popular suggestions I have seen multiple times about learning javascript!
